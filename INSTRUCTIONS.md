# Instructions (v3 — Decipherment Workbench)

## 1. Install

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Python 3.10+ required.

## 2. Get the data

```bash
python -m voynich setup
```

Downloads into `data/` (~35 MB total): the word-level Voynich transcription
(folio/section/Currier/line metadata) and 28 cleaned reference corpora
spanning European, Middle Eastern, African and Asian language families —
see the table in [README.md](README.md). Greek and Cyrillic sources are
transliterated one letter per letter during cleaning.

You can also do this from the GUI's **Data** tab.

## 3. Use the GUI (recommended)

```bash
python -m voynich gui          # http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

* **Validate solver** first: run a benchmark to see the annealer recover a
  known substitution cipher (expect ~100% letter recovery in seconds).
* **Solve**: pick Currier language, reference, hypothesis and budget, then
  start. The run streams its annealing curve and finishes with a report.
* Click any entry under **Runs** to revisit it; reports are also saved as
  JSON under `results/`.

## 4. Or use the CLI

```bash
# A decipherment attempt: Currier A vs. medieval Latin, simple substitution
python -m voynich solve --language A --reference latin --hypothesis simple

# The positional (line-start/body/line-end) hypothesis on Currier B
python -m voynich solve --language B --hypothesis positional --iterations 100000

# Scribal abbreviation (token -> 1-2 letters), vowels unwritten
python -m voynich solve --reference latin --hypothesis abbreviation --abjad

# Anagram hypothesis (letters unordered inside words) with crib locking:
# tokens supported by dictionary-matched words freeze between rounds
python -m voynich solve --reference latin --hypothesis anagram --lock-rounds 3

# Rank ALL 28 reference languages on one configuration
python -m voynich sweep --language A --hypothesis simple --iterations 40000

# Known-answer validation (substitution, abbreviation, anagram ciphers)
python -m voynich benchmark --reference latin
python -m voynich benchmark --reference latin --mode anagram
```

## 5. Reading a report

Every solve reports four numbers (all in mean bits/char under the reference
language model; higher = more language-like):

| Number | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `random-key floor` | what a random key scores — chance level |
| `held-out score` | the best key applied to lines the optimizer never saw |
| `language ceiling` | what real reference-language text scores |
| `gap closed` | where the held-out score sits between floor (0%) and ceiling (100%) |

Interpretation, bluntly:

* **Gap closed near 100%** *and* the decoded sample reads as language →
  a serious candidate. Re-run with other seeds and sections before believing it.
* **50–85%** → the optimizer is exploiting Voynichese's rigid word structure;
  the sample will look like `tee te e rua are te...`. This is the expected
  outcome for substitution hypotheses and is a meaningful *negative* result.
* **< 50%** → the hypothesis/reference pairing does worse than structure
  alone usually allows; the text does not behave like a substitution of that
  language at all.

A high train score with a much lower held-out score means the key memorized
the training lines — the split exists precisely to expose that.

Every report also carries a **dictionary word-match rate** for the decoded
held-out text, split by word length. Short words (3–4 letters) match cheaply;
**long words (≥5) are the hard currency** — real decipherments produce them,
gamed objectives don't. If a run reports gap closed **above 100%** (possible
under anagram scoring), the optimizer beat the objective, not the manuscript;
the verdict text explains this whenever it happens.

## 6. Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

Runs offline. `tests/test_annealer.py` is the load-bearing one: the solver
must recover ≥95% of a synthetic cipher.

## Legacy

* `experiment/` — v1 mod-23 statistical experiment (unchanged, still tested).
* `legacy/v2/` — the previous positional-decoder scripts this workbench replaced.

## Storage, backup and packaged launchers

Source and pip runs use `data/` and `results/` relative to the working directory.
Frozen executables use the per-user `VoynichWorkbench` directory under
`%APPDATA%` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS, or
`$XDG_DATA_HOME` (default `~/.local/share`) on Linux. `VOYNICH_DATA_DIR` and
`VOYNICH_RESULTS_DIR` override these locations. Back up those directories
before removing an installation; do not automatically delete saved results.

The bundled `VoynichWorkbench` executable launches the local web GUI, with
`--port`, `--host` and `--no-browser` options. Solver subcommands shown above
use `python -m voynich`; they are not commands accepted by the frozen launcher.
Completed, stopped and failed runs are atomically saved in the results directory
under `.run-history/`, including benchmarks. They appear in Runs after restart.
Back up this directory along with the standalone solve/sweep/diagnostic reports.
Older standalone reports are preserved but are not automatically imported into
the Runs list. Interrupted running jobs are not automatically resumed. Corrupt
history files are preserved and skipped so healthy results remain available.
